The chart above shows the loss of tropical primary forest, measured in millions of hectares, from 2012 to 2022, divided into non fire related loss and fire related loss

Overall, non fire related forest loss exceeded fire related loss each year from 2012 to 2022, with 2016 seeing the highest total forest loss

In 2012 and 2014, the same amount of forest loss disappeared due to both non fire related forest loss and fire related loss

In 2017, fire related loss was half that of 2016, and in 2018, fire related loss decreased to one third of that in 2017.

Non fire related forest loss decreased in 2021 compared with the three previous years, but then increased again to 3.5 million hectares in 2022

In 2017, fire related forest loss was half that of 2016, and in 2018, fire related forest loss decreased “to one third” of that in 2017.

Non fire related forest loss decreased in 2021 compared to the three previous years, but then increased again 3.5 million hectares in 2022.
