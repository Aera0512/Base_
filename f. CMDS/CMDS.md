# CMDS.md - Context & Philosophy Guide

This file provides context and philosophy for the CMDSPACE (커맨드스페이스) knowledge management system.

## Why This System Exists

CMDS (Connect → Merge → Develop → Share) is a comprehensive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system designed to transform how you capture, process, and share knowledge. It addresses the common challenges of information overload, knowledge fragmentation, and the gap between learning and creating.

## System Purpose

The CMDS framework serves as:
- **Knowledge Hub**: Central repository for all your intellectual work
- **Thinking Tool**: Structured environment for developing ideas
- **Creation Engine**: System for producing outputs from accumulated knowledge
- **Learning System**: Framework for continuous growth and development

## The CMDS Process: Connect → Merge → Develop → Share

## How to Use This System

### For New Notes
1. Identify which CMDS category it belongs to (100-900)
2. Choose appropriate subcategory (N01-N99)
3. Use proper frontmatter with required properties
4. Link to related notes using wikilinks
5. Apply appropriate tags

### For Processing Information
1. **Capture** in `00. Inbox/` first
2. **Process** and categorize into appropriate CMDS folder
3. **Refine** and add connections
4. **Output** when ready to share

### For Creating Outputs

2. **Merge** - Review relevant literature from 200 Literature
3. **Develop** - Apply data and methods from 300-600
4. **Share** - Create deliverable in 700-800

## Integration with Other Systems

### Daily Notes (`00. Inbox/01. Daily Notes/`)
- Capture daily thoughts and activities
- Link to CMDS categories as needed
- Review and process into permanent notes

### Weekly Notes (`00. Inbox/02. Weekly Notes/`)
- Weekly reflection and planning
- Track progress across CMDS categories
- Identify patterns and themes

### Claude Code (`00. Inbox/03. Claude Code/`)
- All code outputs from AI assistance
- Scripts, analysis, automation
- Technical implementations

### Templates (`90. Settings/91. Templates/`)
- Standard note structures
- Consistent formatting
- Quick start for common note types

## Best Practices

### 1. Start in Inbox
Always capture new information in `00. Inbox/` first. Process it later into the appropriate CMDS category.

### 2. Use Consistent Properties
Every note should have:
- `type:` - Note type
- `aliases:` - Alternative names
- `author:` - Author (usually `"[[구요한]]"`)
- `date created:` - Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `tags:` - Relevant tags

### 3. Link Liberally
Use wikilinks `[[]]` to connect related notes. The value of PKM increases with connections.

### 4. Review Regularly
- Daily: Process inbox
- Weekly: Review and refine notes
- Monthly: Identify gaps and opportunities

### 5. Evolve the System
The CMDS framework is flexible. Adapt it to your needs while maintaining the core structure.

## Success Metrics

A well-functioning CMDS system should:
- **Reduce friction** in capturing and processing information

## Remember

The CMDS system is a **tool for thinking**, not just storage. Use it to:
- **Think through** complex problems
- **Develop** original ideas
- **Create** valuable outputs
- **Share** knowledge with others

The system works best when you engage with it regularly and use it as an active thinking partner, not just a passive repository.
