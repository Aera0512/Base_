# 📖 100 Themes

**The Connection Layer** - Interests, topics, variables, terminologies

## Purpose

This is where you capture emerging ideas, interesting concepts, and terminology. Think of it as your personal dictionary and idea garden.

## What Goes Here

- Topic notes: "Machine Learning", "Knowledge Management"
- Terminology definitions
- Variable tracking
- Interest areas
- Emerging themes
- Concept seeds

## CMDS Process Phase

**Connect (연결)** - Idea discovery and connection

This is the first phase of the CMDS process where you:
- Capture interests without judgment
- Tag and categorize themes
- Discover relationships between topics
- Build your web of connected thoughts

## Subcategories

Create subcategories (📚 101-199) as needed for different theme clusters.

## Workflow

1. **Capture** - Add new themes as you discover them
2. **Define** - Write clear definitions for terminology
3. **Connect** - Link related themes together
4. **Evolve** - Let themes grow into literature notes (200) or permanent notes

## Examples

- `AI and Machine Learning` - Broad topic area
- `Zettelkasten` - Specific methodology term
- `Flow State` - Psychological concept
- `Second Brain` - PKM terminology
- `Productivity Paradox` - Interesting phenomenon

## Tips

- Start broad, refine later
- Use consistent naming
- Link liberally
- Don't overthink - just capture!
- Review periodically to identify patterns
